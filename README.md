# Copy URL to Clipboard - Firefox Extension

This extension copies the URL to the clipboard with the keyboard shortcut `Command + Shift + U` (macOS) or `Control + Shift + U` (Windows/Linux).

## Installation

Since this isn't published on the Extension store, you'll have to follow [Mozilla's documentation on installing temporary extensions](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-workshop/blob/master/src/content/documentation/develop/temporary-installation-in-firefox.md).

## Configuration

You can use a different keyboard shortcut by changing the code in the `manifest.json`.
